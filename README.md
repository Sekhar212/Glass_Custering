# Glass_Custering
By using the refractive index (RI), weight percent in each oxide with hierarchical clustering algorithm to segment the glass type.

In this project, I have explored the fascinating realm of glass analysis, leveraging the power of data to identify distinct glass types based on 
their unique characteristics. By incorporating the refractive index, a key optical property, along with the weight percent of various oxides, 
I have formulated a comprehensive approach to uncover meaningful patterns and groupings within the glass dataset.

Through the implementation of a hierarchical clustering algorithm, I have been able to effectively segment the glass types, 
facilitating a deeper understanding of their composition and properties. This technique enables us to discover hidden relationships 
among different glass samples, leading to insights that can enhance manufacturing processes, product quality, and even guide future research directions.

Throughout this portfolio, I provide a detailed account of my methodology, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, 
and the clustering algorithm employed. I also showcase the visualizations and analysis techniques used to interpret and present the results in a clear 
and concise manner.

By applying my expertise in data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization, I have successfully demonstrated how the refractive index 
and oxide weight percentages can be harnessed to efficiently categorize and classify glass samples.
